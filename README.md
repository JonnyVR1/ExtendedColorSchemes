# Extended Color Schemes

Extended Color Schemes is a Beat Saber mod that allows the user to have many more customizable color schemes than is currently available in the game. There are 16 more schemes added by default, but you can add (or delete some) by carefully editing the configuration file here: `Beat Saber\UserData\ExtendedColorSchemes.json`

## Disclaimer 

No matter if you choose to manually edit this file or using the mod as is, <ins>**you should backup the game's save file**</ins> as some issues were initially encountered where the data was completely erased. These issues should be fixed now, but it doesn't hurt to take precautions.

Type `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Hyperbolic Magnetism\Beat Saber` into Windows Explorer, then backup the file `PlayerData.dat`.
